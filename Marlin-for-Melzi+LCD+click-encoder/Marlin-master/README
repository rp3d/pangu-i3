Thanks for getting me motivated to try this. I got the same rotary encoder and a similar display. I didn't wanted to move around printer parameters between firmwares so i gave the RepRapPro Source a try and i managed to get it to work... even if it took the whole weekend.

This is a modified version of Marlin for RepRapPro printers.
The goal is to add basic support for I2C-displays and rotary encoders.

Tested on these printers so far:
RepRapPro Huxley with Melzi (Ornotermes)

Tested with the following hardware:

You need a LiquidCrystal_I2C-library in your Arduino IDE that works with your display.
